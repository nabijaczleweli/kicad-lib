| Property                     | Value                                           |
| --------                     | -----                                           |
| Winding Φ                    | `0.5`                                           |
| Windings                     | `50`                                            |
| Lead length past winding     | `14`                                            |
| Empty distance between leads | `6.3` (outer)                                   |
| Lead pitch                   | `2 * 2.54√2 ≈ 7.18`                             |
| Core depth                   | `5`                                             |
| Core inner Φ                 | `5 + 2 * 0.5 = 6`                               |
| Core outer Φ                 | `14.5 - 2 * 0.5 = 13.5`                         |
| Core colour                  | celadon                                         |
| Core lacquer                 | blue (1 face)                                   |
| Empty angle between leads    | `6.3 / 13.5π ≈ 0.1485 ≈ 53.47°`                 |
| Winding angle step           | `(13.5π - 6.3) / 13.5π / 50 ≈ 0.0170 ≈ 0.9756°` |
| Winding outer step           | `(13.5π - 6.3) / (0.5 * 50) ≈ 1.44`             |

Winding step distribution is half for corners (=> each one is eighth), rest for short straights

The center-to-center lead distance is 7.18 at 3.5mm below the outer edge of the core, a sad byproduct of how I assembled the windings and having already spent and entire day on this model and I'm sick of looking at it
