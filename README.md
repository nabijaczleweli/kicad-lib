Web was missing some symbols/models/footprints for some electronics components I was using: that's them

3D models are provided as a [SOLVESPACE](//solvespace.com) model and a STEP file, which can be used directly by KiCad.

Symbols are provided as individual KiCad libraries.

Footprints are provided as individual importable `.kicad_mod`s.
